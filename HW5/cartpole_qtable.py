## buckets for continuous state values to be assigned to
## Observation space: [position of cart, velocity of cart, angle of pole, rotation rate of pole]
## Setting bucket size to 1 = ignoring the particular observation state 
## Take example: if we set the bucket of the angle of pole as 6, then it means we divide the angles into 6 
## partition, it means that degree 0 ~ degree 30 corresponds to same interger value(i.e 0), and dgree 30. 
## ~ dgree 60 corresponds to another identical value(i.e 1) and so on.
## You can try different kind of partition combination to help you train your model
